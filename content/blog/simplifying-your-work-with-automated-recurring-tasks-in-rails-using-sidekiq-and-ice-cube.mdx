## **1/ Understanding Automated Recurring Tasks**

Imagine having a helper who can handle repetitive tasks for you without any manual intervention. That's exactly what automated recurring tasks do! With the right setup, your Rails application can automatically perform tasks like sending reminders, updating records, and more at scheduled intervals.

## **2/ The Power of Sidekiq and Ice Cube**

1. **Sidekiq:** Sidekiq is a fantastic tool that makes background processing a breeze in Rails. It's like having a dedicated worker who takes care of tasks behind the scenes, leaving your application responsive and speedy.
2. **Ice Cube Gem:** Ice Cube is your scheduling assistant. It helps you define when and how often tasks should be executed. It's like having a personal scheduler who never misses an appointment.

## **3/ Real-Life Examples**

1. **Sending Weekly Reports:** Let's say you want to send weekly reports to your team. With Sidekiq and Ice Cube, you can automate this process. Define the schedule using Ice Cube, and let Sidekiq handle the sending part.
2. **Updating Records:** Need to update records on a regular basis? Whether it's archiving old data or marking items as completed, your automated worker can take care of it, thanks to Sidekiq and Ice Cube.

## **4/ Getting Started**

1. **Setting Up Sidekiq:** Install and configure Sidekiq in your Rails application. This gem handles the background processing efficiently.
2. **Integrating Ice Cube:** Include the Ice Cube gem in your project to handle the scheduling aspects of your automated tasks.
3. **Creating Recurring Tasks:** Use the power of Ice Cube to define the schedules for your tasks. Whether it's daily, weekly, or custom intervals, Ice Cube has you covered.
4. **Implementing Workers:** Write Sidekiq workers that encapsulate the tasks you want to automate. These workers will be responsible for executing the scheduled actions.
