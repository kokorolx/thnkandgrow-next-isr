In today's fast-paced tech landscape, efficient container orchestration is crucial for managing complex applications. Docker Swarm, a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers, offers a simple yet powerful solution for deploying and managing multi-container applications. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of Docker Swarm, its key features, and provide a step-by-step guide to get you started.

### What is Docker Swarm?

Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool that enables the management of a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications across multiple hosts. Docker Swarm transforms a group of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker engine.

### Key Features of Docker Swarm

1. **Simple Setup and Configuration**: Docker Swarm is integrated into Docker, making it straightforward to set up and configure.

2. **High Availability**: Swarm provides fault tolerance and high availability by ensuring that services are replicated across multiple nodes.

3. **Scalability**: Easily scale your services up or down with a single command.

4. **Rolling Updates**: Update services without downtime by using rolling updates.

5. **Declarative Service Model**: Define the desired state of the services, and Swarm ensures the cluster matches this state.

6. **Multi-host Networking**: Swarm handles multi-host networking, enabling communication between containers across different hosts.

### Getting Started with Docker Swarm

#### Step 1: Install Docker

Before diving into Docker Swarm, ensure Docker is installed on all the nodes that will be part of your Swarm cluster. You can download Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

#### Step 2: Open Necessary Ports

Docker Swarm requires certain ports to be open for communication between nodes. Ensure the following ports are open on all nodes:

- TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications

- TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes

- UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic

You can open these ports using `iptables` or your cloud provider's security groups.

#### Step 3: Initialize Docker Swarm

To initialize Docker Swarm, choose a manager node and run the following command:

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

Replace `<MANAGER-IP>` with the IP address of the manager node. This command initializes the current node as a manager node and ensures it advertises its address correctly.

#### Step 4: Add Worker Nodes to the Swarm

On each worker node, run the command provided by the `docker swarm init` output on the manager node. It will look something like this:

```
docker swarm join --advertise-addr
```

Replace `<TOKEN>` and `<MANAGER-IP>` with the actual token and IP address of your manager node.

Replace the `<WORKER-PUBLIC-IP>` with the actual public IP address of your worker node.

## Steps to Deploy

1/ **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone git@github.com-kokorolx:kokorolx/snowflake_id_web.git
cd snowflake_id_web
```

**2/ Deploy the Stack:**

```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
```

**3/ Verify the Deployment:**

Check the status of your stack and services:
`   docker stack ls   docker stack services my_stack   docker service ls`
NOTE:
**Service Constraints:** The database service (db) is constrained to run on manager nodes with placement.constraints.
**Replicas:** The web service is configured to run with 2 replicas for high availability.
**Update Configuration:** The update_config specifies how updates should be applied, including parallelism and delay.
